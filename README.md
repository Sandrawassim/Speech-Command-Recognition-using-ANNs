# Speech-Command-Recognition-using-ANNs
## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to build a model that recognizes spoken digit commands (from 0 to 9) using MFCC features extracted from audio clips. The project explores both Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to achieve high accuracy, aiming for over 85% accuracy on the test set.
